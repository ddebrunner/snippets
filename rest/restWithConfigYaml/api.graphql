# this shows how query arguments are automatically substituted into the REST call
# However, you can also get REST query parameters from config.yaml file
# In this example, `apikey` is obtained from `config.yaml`
# And wehave also removed `apikey` from the response, since you do not
# want any chance of your apikey leakage
# You can generate this entire code using 
# `stepzen import curl "https://httpbin.org/get?q=a&q=b&apikey=56hdlks45reghunq" -H "Accept:application/json"`
# You might have to do some editing to delete `apikey` entry in `type Args`
# We use `httpbin.org` because it allows us to show features without any real REST API behind it
# The httpbin service returns some payload depending on the call
# You should always try the curl call directly
